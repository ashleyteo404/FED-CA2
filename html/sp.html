The school set up themed banners and backgrounds for the seniors to take some memorable final pictures as students of Singapore Polytechnic (SP) who had finally completed their diplomas. Everyone was dressed up in formal wear or graduation gowns. As for us? We were decked out in home clothes that might as well have been pyjamas. We just wanted to play "pretend graduation". So, we asked a random graduating senior to help us take a bunch of pictures. And, for whatever reason that we were so entertained, we proceeded to do this repeatedly over the next few days while the different batches of seniors from different schools in SP graduated.<br /><br /> -->

After the first round, the lecturer decided to motivate the rest of the class by giving us a chance to win together. "If everyone in the class gets 3 questions right in a row, everyone gets a shirt." Halfway through the Kahoot, we cheered in victory, but it wasn't over yet. Another offer was made: "Double or nothing" The class glanced at each other in contemplation. A combination of cockiness and greed spurred us to agree. However, it wouldn't come to us easily. 10 questions left to go, and we were getting antsy. We just couldn't seem to get 3 questions in a row, or even 1 at all as a class. But, lo and behold, with 4 questions remaining, we somehow completed our task. True to his word, ourlecturer gifted everyone 2 shirts each.<br /><br /> -->

A nice little greeting if you will. There were 2 lifts so we took a 50/50 bet. The funniest part was when this sweet janitor came into the lift. She tried to make conversation, asking my friend if he was headed to Level 2, like her, to eat. He lied and said yes, because how do you explain that you're not headed to any floor since you're waiting for your lecturer? But, who would have thought that our lecturer would be right there when the lift doors opened up at Level 2? We greeted him with enthusiasm and were about to head up to class when the auntie asked my friend, "Boy, aren't you hungry?" We burst into laughter as he awkwardly replied, "Uh...Suddenly, I'm full." while the lift doors closed.<br /><br /> -->

Yes, these are the shirts from the story "Class: 1, Lecturer: 0". After a long day of school, we took around 5 minutes to gather and spam the camera with the help of our lecturer. Thankfully, this was just the beginning of many class pictures to be taken in the future, especially featuring the iconic shirts that we had won; one black and one white dri-fit Singapore Polytechnic shirt. With that picture taken, I couldn't help but look forward to the rest of the time I have left with this class. I had always longed to know what it was like to be in a bonded class yet somehow always ended up in some of the least bonded classes in the cohort. Finally, my curiosity has been satisifed. It has been everything and more than what I expected.<br /><br />  -->
